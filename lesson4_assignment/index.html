        <h1>The Evolution of Social Media</h1>
        
        <h2><em>Overview</em></h2>
        
        <p>The age of technology is upon us, and with new technologies being created and exposed to the public comes new oppurtunities to communicate with others around the world. Social media has become a daily part of life for many of us as this digital age intensifies.</p>
        
        <p>How many social media applications do you have on your device right now? How many have you used today? For many people around the world, social media has become just another casual way of communication with both friends and the general public. With 3.196 billion global social media users in 2018, these applications have become a hugely significant aspect of communication (Smart Insights).</p>
        
        <p>Facebook was one of the first major social media platform created. It was founded by Mark Zuckerberg in 2004 to be a site for Harvard students. However, as we all know, this site became much more than a simple university website (History Cooperative).  </p>
        
        <p>Since Facebook, many other websites and applications have emerged to provide similar services. Instagram, Twitter, Youtube, Snapchat, and Pinterest are just some of the many popular applications used today (Pew Research Center). Social media has developed to provide certain purposes and messages to allow the user to convey. Whether it be through picture, video, text, or a mixture of all three, social media allows anyone with internet access to communicate or observe the thoughts and moments of others.</p>
